        <p>I’m seeking for a remote job as Web Developer. I'm a civil service passer - professional. I'm a sophomore at Brigham Young University in Idaho, where I'm working for an associate's degree in applied technology. My Web Frontend Certificate has helped me hone my web design, C#, PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills. My second certificate, in computer programming, is currently being pursued. Each opportunity and experience I have had has helped strengthen and clarified my future career in web development.
